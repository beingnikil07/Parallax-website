        Five Best Places To Visit The Amazon Jungle To See Wildlife
      </h1>
      <h2 style="text-align: left">1.Jau National Park (Brazil)</h2>
      <p class="description">
        One of the biggest national parks in Amazonia at more than 5.6 million
        acres, Jau protects the entirety of the Rio Jau watershed, its borders
        running north to the Unini and Paunini rivers and south to the
        Caribinani River, and including the Jau’s confluence with the mighty Rio
        Negro (the blackwater river serving as one of the Amazon’s greatest
        tributaries). Established in 1980, Jau is now part of the UNESCO World
        Heritage Site of the enormous Central Amazon Conservation Complex,
        bigger than Switzerland and considered the world’s largest expanse of
        protected tropical rainforest. Jau National Park’s mosaic of caminarana
        upland forest and scrub, terra firme rainforest, and extensive igapó
        flooded blackwater forest supports an impressive diversity of wildlife.
        The roster’s made up of some 120 mammal species, 455 birds, 150
        reptiles, and more than 280 kinds of fish.Those who visit the park by
        boat (the only way to access it) can keep their eyes peeled for
        Amazonian manatees, pink river dolphins, giant otters, and no fewer than
        four species of caimans (including the great black caiman) in the flow.
        Bush and short-eared dogs, jaguars, giant anteaters, giant armadillos,
        and other terrestrial mammals reside here, while the canopy shakes and
        rustles with rare primates such as the white-bellied spider monkey and
        the golden-backed black uakari, rubbing shoulders with Amazon parrots
        and the kingly harpy eagle. Jau’s about 125 miles northwest of Manaus,
        the main jumping-off point for river cruises to the park and host to
        such hotels and lodges as Juna Opera, Amazon Ecopark, and Anavilhanas
        Jungle Lodge.
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: left">2.Manu National Park (Peru)</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Located in the Amazon of southeastern Peru, the Manu National Park is a
        designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. This park, also called the Manu
        Biosphere Reserve, is chock full of amazing wildlife, including giant
        otters, wattled jacanas, jaguars, and various monkeys. It is also home
        to some 20,000 plant species, including significant water lilies. If
        you’re a birdwatcher, this is the place to be to admire tanagers,
        macaws, and toucans. You may also encounter a hoatzin, an odd bird
        unique to the Amazon.

      <h2 style="text-align: left">3.Plaza de Armas de Iquitos</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Explore what it feels like to be enveloped in a jungle canopy at the
        Pacaya Samiria National Reserve in Peru. Wildlife lives in the tops of
        the trees here, and you’ll be able to get a closer look at them. If
        you’re feeling particularly brave or looking to experience an extra
        thrill, make your way across the La Posado canopy bridge for a
        spectacular view of this diverse ecosystem.
      </p>

      <h2 style="text-align: left">4. Tambopata National Reserve</h2>
      <p class="description">
        For a study in the plant life of Amazonia, head to the Tambopata
        National Reserve inside Peru. Here you’ll stand in awe of the 50-meter
        tall Ceiba tree, the 40-meter-high Brazil Nut tree, and the ironwood
        trees that are 500 years old. Stroll along the well-marked trails as
        your guide reveals details of the various plant life located underneath
        the jungle canopy. Take your time admiring the delicate orchids, grassy
        ferns, vibrant bromeliads, and various twisting and tangled vines. You
        can access the reserve from the city of Puerto Maldonado in the
        southeastern part of Peru.

      <h2 style="text-align: left">5.Cachoeira de Iracema Waterfall</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Deep within the Brazilian rainforest, you’ll find thundering waterfalls
        descending from up above and creating awe-inspiring pools below. This
        area is known as the Land of Waterfalls, or Terra de Cachoeiras. One
        waterfall in particular to visit is the Iracema Waterfall. Hire a guidea
        and head into the forest to explore along the Urubui River before
        reaching the Iracema, where you’ll catch glimpses of the indigenous
        wildlife there. At the bottom of this waterfall, you can cool off and
        relax in the shallow waters. You also might enjoy exploring the
        sandstone caves nearby. A truly astounding ecological adventure, you’ll
        be glad you came.

        Let's Explore Some important Facts About Amazon
      </h1>
      <p style="font-size: 17px; text-align: left" class="description">
        The Amazon is an incredibly unique place. It is the world’s largest rain
        forest and river system, and the most biologically diverse place on
        Earth. It contains millions of species, most of them still undescribed.
        Both the Amazon’s forest and freshwater systems are at risk. Since the
        year 2000, rainfall has declined across 69% of the Amazon forest. WWF
        estimates that 27% of the Amazon biome will be without trees by 2030 if
        the current rate of deforestation continues. Protecting and conserving
        the Amazon is no easy task, but WWF has been working to save this
        important place
      </p>

      <h2 class="facts-qn">1.What animals live in the Amazon ?</h2>
      <p class="description">
        The Amazon is one of Earth’s last refuges for jaguars, harpy eagles, and
        pink river dolphins, and it is home to sloths, black spider monkeys, and
        poison dart frogs. It contains one in 10 known species on Earth, 40,000
        plant species, 3,000 freshwater fish species, and more than 370 types of
        reptiles. Over 2,000 new species of plants and vertebrates, including a
        monkey that purrs like a cat, have been described since 1999.
      </p>
      <img src="./images/Q1.jpg" class="img-res" />
      <h2 class="facts-qn">2. How many countries does the Amazon span ?</h2>
      <p class="description">
        This vast region, about two-thirds the size of the US, spans eight
        countries: Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana,
        Suriname, and the overseas territory of French Guiana. Covering about
        40% of South America, the Amazon contains 1.4 billion acres of dense
        forests, half of the planet’s remaining tropical forests, 4,100 miles of
        winding rivers and 2.6 million square miles in the Amazon basin

      <h2 class="facts-qn">
        3. What kind of birds can you see in the Amazon ?
      </h2>
      <p class="description">
        Home to more than a thousand different species of birds like
        hummingbirds, channel-billed toucans, hoatzins and macaws, the Amazon is
        one of the most diverse areas for birds in the world. Macaws, an icon of
        the Amazon, are highly intelligent and social, living in flocks of 10 to
        30 birds. They mate for life and can live up to 60 years. Some species
        can even mimic human speech. But macaws are under threat from
        deforestation and the illegal pet trade.
      </p>
      <img src="./images/Q3.jpg" alt="" class="img-res" />
      <h2 class="facts-qn">4. Why is the Amazon important?</h2>
      <p class="description">
        More than 30 million people, including 350 indigenous and ethnic groups,
        live in the Amazon and depend on nature for agriculture, clothing, and
        traditional medicines. There is also a clear link between the health of
        the Amazon and the health of the planet. The rain forests, which contain
        90 billion to 140 billion metric tons of carbon, help stabilize local
        and global climate. The Amazon also pumps about 7 trillion tons of water
        per year into the atmosphere, and its forests recycle 50%-75% of annual
        rainfall back into the atmosphere.

      <h2 class="facts-qn">5. What threats does the Amazon face?</h2>
      <p class="description">
        The Amazon faces many threats, including deforestation from extensive
        cattle ranching and agricultural expansion, poorly planned
        infrastructure, illegal and unsustainable natural resource extraction,
        and climate change
